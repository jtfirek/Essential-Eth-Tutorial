Here is a link to the `Pool.t.sol` that completes the assigned task:

After completing a Solidity assignment, I decided to build a full-stack Dapp uses all the skills you guys are looking for in the Decentralized Application Front End Developer. My Dapp enables users to create their own ERC-20 tokens, wrap ETH into ERC-20s, deploy an ERC20/ERC20 Uniswap V2 liquidity pool, and withdraw liquidity using a metamask wallet.


# Project Structure

- `Frontend`: built with React, Next.js, Chakra UI, and ether.js
- `backend`: Node.js server with a GraphQL gateway
- `contracts`: deployed Solidity smart contracts
- `migrates`: scripts for deploying contracts
- `forge-tests`: tests the smart contracts and contains the orginial task
